        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We've been taking travellers around the globe and connecting people from all walks of life since 1989.

That's over 30 years of adventures, visiting new places and old friends, and countless, unforgettable moments. More than 30 years of changing the way people see the world on small group trips with like-minded explorers and a local leader to show you around.

But to us, it's about more than just seeing the world, it's about experiencing it. It's about feeling its pulse and the shared rhythms of Intrepid people all over the world. To be Intrepid is far more than a lust for travel, we're an antidote to loneliness. We connect people to the heartbeat of adventure and the soul of the planet.

        </p>
        <h1>Our Team</h1>
        <p>It all began with two explorers
Intrepid was founded by two friends, Darrell and Geoff, who had a bold idea to build a travel company that benefited both travellers and the communities they visit.

Their big idea sprung to mind in 1988, not long after they crammed themselves and some friends into a modified ex-council truck and headed off on a roadtrip across Africa. More than three decades later, we're proud to call ourselves the world's largest purpose-led adventure travel company.
